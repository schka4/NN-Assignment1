cifar10_in.py for getting cifar10 data

              the cifar10 files are needed
              
              using: models/tutorials/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py

nearest_neighbor.py calculate the most similar image's label for an image set and test  the precision

fc.py is a fully connected multilayer neural network

convcifar.py is a convolutional neural network

comparing.py import the three script above, which give the own precisions
